# Hello MIcroverse project

> In this project, I  set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. The goal was to master all of the tools and best practices learned about in previous steps. Which I will be using  in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!.
