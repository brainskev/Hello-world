# Hello MIcroverse project

> This is the first microverse project. I created a "Hello world" repository for this project. simple code was sufficient because mainly, the objective was to develop an authority in all of the tools and best practices that were covered in previous stages. Which are essential  because I'll be using them in all of my Microverse projects and perhaps even at my next job.
